  #When this option is enabled, Azurite automatically calculates how to distribute plugins across threads each time a plugin is loaded.
  #It splits the plugin into multiple threads based on its modules, allowing faster loading.
  #However, note that this process will temporarily increase CPU usage during startup.

  #note
  #Do not enable this option when multithreading is already active.
  #Although it can make plugins load faster, it will significantly increase CPU usage.
